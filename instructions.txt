Enterprise Software Engineering – Assignment 1 / 2 (Individual Assessment, 70%)
The ESE module has two assignments, and this is the first one.
1. Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will design, implement, and deploy an enterprise-style full-stack
web application that addresses a real-world problem. The focus of this assessment is on
applying enterprise software engineering principles, including architectural separation,
secure system design, deployment practices, and testing.
This assignment builds on earlier modules (including Software Quality Assurance), but
places greater emphasis on independent system design and implementation rather than
scaffolded development or documentation-heavy quality planning.
Important:
Not all features described in this brief are required to achieve a pass. The marking rubric
explains how the scope, completeness, and enterprise maturity of your solution affect the
final grade. Students are encouraged to prioritise correctness, clarity, and understanding
before adding additional features.

2. System Architecture Model

For this module, your application is expected to follow a three-
layer enterprise architecture:

 Frontend: a client-side application implemented using
React
 Middleware: a REST API implemented using Django
(e.g. Django REST Framework)
This layer is responsible for authentication, authorisation,
business logic, validation, and communication with the
database.
 Backend: a database layer (e.g. PostgreSQL) used for
persistent data storage
The frontend must communicate only with the middleware
(REST API).
The database must be accessed only via the middleware, not
directly by the frontend.

3. Application Scope and Functional Expectations
You may choose any appropriate enterprise application domain (for example: task
management, booking systems, inventory tracking, simple CRM, etc.). See Appendix A for
further guidance on application functionality guidance.
3.1 User Management
At a basic level, your application should support:
 User registration
 User login
 Secure authentication (for example, token-based authentication)
More complete user management (such as editable user profiles and password reset
functionality) is not required to pass, but contributes to higher marks, as outlined in the
marking rubric.

3.2 Domain Functionality
Your application should include domain-specific functionality relevant to the chosen
problem.
Stronger submissions will demonstrate:
 At least one well-designed domain-specific CRUD feature
 Server-side validation
 Meaningful business logic
Implementing multiple domain features is rewarded at higher grade bands.

4. Architecture and Design Expectations
Your application should demonstrate a clear separation of concerns between layers:
 React frontend focused on user interaction and presentation
 Django-based REST API acting as the middleware layer
 PostgreSQL database used exclusively for persistence
Higher-quality submissions will demonstrate:
 Modular and maintainable API design
 Secure authentication and protected endpoints
 Consideration of scalability and extensibility

5. Technology Stack
5.1 Supported Stack
Module teaching, examples, and reference implementations are based on the following stack:
 Frontend: React
 Middleware (REST API): Django / Django REST Framework
 Backend (Database): PostgreSQL
You are encouraged to use the supported stack to align with teaching materials and
available support. If you already have experience with alternative stacks, you may discuss
this with your lecturer. While other stacks (for example MERN or similar full-stack
frameworks) may be used, teaching and technical support will be primarily limited to React,
Django, and PostgreSQL.

6. Repositories and Code Organisation
You are expected to maintain two separate GitHub repositories:
1. A frontend repository containing the React application
2. A middleware repository containing the Django REST API
The database schema, models, and migrations form part of the middleware repository.
Reference implementations will be demonstrated during the module for guidance only. You
are expected to implement your solution independently.

7. Security and External Integrations
7.1 Security Expectations
Your application should demonstrate appropriate security practices for the level attempted,
such as:
 Secure password storage
 Authentication-protected API endpoints
 Clear handling of authentication and authorisation errors
More advanced authentication workflows (e.g. full JWT-based authentication, password reset
flows) contribute to higher marks.

7.2 External Services (Encouraged)
Integration with external services commonly used in enterprise systems is encouraged, but
not required to achieve a pass.
Examples include:
 Email services (e.g. using SendGrid for password reset or system notifications)
 Cloud-based media storage (e.g. using Cloudinary for storing user-uploaded files such
as profile images)
These integrations are explicitly rewarded at higher grade bands. External services such as
email delivery and cloud-based media storage are widely used in enterprise applications to
improve reliability, scalability, and separation of concerns. Leveraging services like email
providers and managed storage platforms allows teams to offload non-core infrastructure
responsibilities while ensuring secure, performant, and maintainable systems.

8. Deployment Expectations
You are expected to demonstrate some level of deployment, appropriate to the grade band
you are aiming for.
 Deploying a single component (frontend or middleware) may be sufficient at lower
bands
 Deploying both frontend and middleware, with secure configuration, contributes to
higher marks
 Evidence of CI/CD practices is rewarded at the highest level
Module learning materials will focus on deploying applications using the free Render
platform. Students may use alternative deployment platforms if they are familiar with them;
however, support will be aligned with Render, and students are responsible for ensuring
that only freely available services are used, as no costs will be reimbursed by Ada. If in
doubt, check with your lecturer.
Students should briefly demonstrate a successful deployment or deployment attempt I the
video recording and include all relevant deployment links in their README documentation.
It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that deployment links are functional at the time of
marking; while marking will normally take place within three weeks of submission, students
must ensure that any free-tier services used (for example, PostgreSQL on Render) remain
active and accessible for at least three weeks from the submission date.

9. Testing Expectations
You are expected to demonstrate appropriate testing practices for an enterprise application,
such as:

 Unit tests
 API tests
 Tests covering authentication or core domain logic

10. Documentation
Documentation should clearly explain:
 Application setup and usage
 Architecture and layering
 Key technical decisions
Higher-quality submissions will include two clear README files, one for the frontend
repository and one for the middleware repository.

11. Video Demonstration – Student Checklist (≤ 20
minutes)
Use this checklist to structure your video. You should move between the user interface,
code, database, and external tools where relevant. This is lecturer guidance; always refer
to the marking rubric for final assessment criteria.
Core User Flows
 Demonstrate user registration
 Demonstrate user login and authentication behaviour
Password Reset (Email Integration – if implemented)
 Trigger password reset from the UI
 Show the reset email being received (e.g. via SendGrid or similar)
 Click the reset link, reset the password, and log in successfully
 Briefly show where email integration is handled in the backend
Domain Functionality (CRUD)
 Demonstrate one or more CRUD features (create, edit, delete)
 Show the effect of actions via the API and/or database
 Highlight validation or business logic
Media Storage (if implemented)
 Upload and display a file (e.g. profile image)
 Show that the file is stored externally (e.g. Cloudinary)
 Briefly explain how the integration works
Enterprise Qualities
 Explain security features (authentication, protected routes, password handling)
 Highlight modularity and maintainability (clean structure, separation of concerns)
 Mention any scalability considerations
Testing
 Show the presence of tests (unit and/or API tests)
 Explain what is being tested and why
 Demonstrate tests running successfully (where possible)
Deployment
 Show the deployed application running (frontend and/or backend)
 Open and demonstrate live deployment link(s)
Deployment Good Practices
 Show use of environment variables and secure configuration
 Mention CI/CD setup if applicable

12. Use of Generative AI
You may use generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to support learning and
development.
However:
 You remain responsible for all submitted work
 You must understand and be able to explain your implementation
 AI usage must be acknowledged in the readme document
This module is classified as YELLOW under institutional AI guidance.

13. Submission Requirements
You must submit:
1. A link to your frontend (React) repository
2. A link to your middleware (Django REST API) repository
3. A link to your 20-minute (maximum) video demonstration

Final note
A smaller, well-architected system that is clearly explained will score higher than a larger
system with weak separation or limited understanding.
